Free Falling Hopia
==================

A film music score for the piano

## History

Free Falling Hopia is one of the musical pieces I wrote while exploring the features
of a Casio keyboard hooked up to GarageBand.  It has been sitting in my hard
drive for a long time since until I ended up using it for a [film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1826835/) I was scoring.  I am now making it available to the public under a Creative Commons license.
